# Half-Cat Rocket Motor Simulator

This repository contains a Python-based rocket motor simulator and optimizer, based on the original Excel-based simulator by Half Cat Rocketry. The project extends the original work by implementing it in Python and adding a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization.

## Attribution

This project is based on the Half Cat Rocketry motor simulator. The original Excel-based simulator was created by Half Cat Rocketry (https://halfcatrocketry.com/). This Python implementation maintains the core simulation logic while adding new features and capabilities.
